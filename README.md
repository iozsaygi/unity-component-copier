## About
**U.C.U** allows you to perform handy operations for components on game objects.

## Features
* **Copy & Paste**
    * _Copy or paste components between game objects._
* **Delete** 
    * _Deletes all the attached components on game object(s)._
* **Merge**
    * _Gets all of the components from selected game objects and adds them into new single game object._
* **Separate**
    * _Creates new game object for each attached component on selected game object._

## Installation
* Create new folder called **"Editor"** as a subfolder of your **"Scripts"** folder.
* Import the **[script](https://github.com/iozsaygi/unity-component-utilities/tree/master/unity-component-utilities/Assets/Scripts/Editor/UCU)** into **"Editor"** folder that you just created.

## Changelog
View **[here](https://github.com/iozsaygi/unity-component-copier/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** for changelog.

## Additional Information
* Due to weird editor bug in some versions of Unity engine, **Merge & Separate** functionalities may run more than once when working with multiple game objects. To avoid this bug you can use the menu that is located at the **top left** corner of Unity engine. (Instead of using right click menu)
  * _[Here](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/menuitem-is-executed-more-than-once-when-multiple-objects-are-selected) is the link of issue about this topic._

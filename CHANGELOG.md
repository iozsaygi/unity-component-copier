## 17 June, 2019 (v1.5)
* **Bug fix:** The **"Merge & Separate"** functions were running more than once when working with multiple selected game objects. Fixed this bug with simple time check.
```csharp
private static float functionTriggerInterval = 0.0f;

[MenuItem("BlaBla/VoVo/DoDo")]
private static void YourEditorFunction() {
    if (Time.unscaledTime.Equals(functionTriggerInterval))
        return;
        
    Debug.Log("This will run only once for multiple selected transforms/game objects!");

    functionTriggerInterval = Time.unscaledTime;
}
```
